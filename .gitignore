# Cri supports multiple Ruby versions (as specified by the
# `required_ruby_version` property of the individual gemspec files), and so it
# does not make sense to lock to a single Ruby version. You can still create
# your own .ruby-version file locally; it just won’t be (and shouldn’t be)
# committed.
